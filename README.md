# Password_Sprayer_from_bash
Password splaying in MS-AD env. Checking if password's valide on the default "NETLOGON" DC share


```
              PASSWORD       DC_IP       DOMAINE_NAME          USERS_LIST
./script.sh SuperPass000! 192.168.0.5 superdomaine.local /tmp/AD_Users_List.txt

```


(You have an error if the password's ending with "!!", that's normal if you check the code but I'm to busy actually :p, send me the solution !)
